  Planchette's LSP-only surface (`Planchette.SupTree`'s supervision tree,
  `Planchette.Focus`'s flowistry slices) hangs off `module_extraction`
  and `relation_facts` by query name from its own modules; nothing here
  depends on it.

  There is no whole-program fact node. Everything downstream of extraction
  is projected — per module, then per relation, then per analysis — so an
  edit propagates only along the relations it actually moved.

  The line-shift immunity story: a whitespace/comment edit changes the
  beam (Line/Dbgi chunks) → `module_extraction` recomputes and differs
  (its `line_info` rows changed) → `module_semantic_facts` recomputes,
  produces an EQUAL value → roux backdates it → every projection below it
  validates green without executing. Zero Souffle runs for a comment edit.

  The body-edit story: an edit that changes what a function COMPUTES but
  not what it CALLS moves `instruction` and friends, so the analyses that
  anchor at instruction sites re-solve — but `supervisor`, `sync_call` and
  the rest of the structural relations backdate at
  `module_relation_facts`, so `relation_facts` never executes for them and
  the supervision analyses stop before Souffle.

  Rule fidelity: every analysis stays in Souffle — the `.dl` files are
  the single source of truth, and incremental findings must equal batch
  `Argus.Findings.run/2` exactly (the honesty principle). Fact rows are
  sorted per relation so equal extractions produce equal values (roux
  compares with `==`); Souffle has set semantics, so ordering cannot
  change results.

  Purity deviation: `analysis_facts_dir`, `stage0_facts` and
  `souffle_solve` touch the filesystem and shell out — content-addressed
  and idempotent, the same pragmatic loophole as the frontend's code
  loading.

  ## Shared-layer contract

  This module is consumed by BOTH planchette (LSP, in-memory compile
  frontend) and scry's Mix compiler (disk-beam frontend). Roux dispatches
  queries by NAME and memo keys are `{query_name, key}`, so **query
  names, key shapes, and value shapes are the ABI** — rename nothing
  without revisiting every consumer and its persisted manifests. The
  frontend contract this module demands, by name: the queries
  `:module_beam`, `:module_map`, and `:file_of`, and the input
  `:env_fingerprint` (inputs are the frontend's to declare — this module
  defines queries only).
